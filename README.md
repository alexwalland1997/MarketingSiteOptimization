# MarketingSiteOptimization

## Description

This task required me to refactor a pre-existing website to make it more accessible to people who use screen readers to meet requirements set out by W3. I have learnt how to efficently add semantic tags and titles to a page to help those using screen readers determine what it is they are looking at and motivates me to make sure all future sites I make are fully accessible to all people.

## Installation

In order to run this site you need to download this repo and open the index.html in the browser of your choice. Alternatively the code can be located at https://alexwalland1997.github.io/MarketingSiteOptimization/

## Usage

To see the accessibility changes put in place you can see these through using the inspect tool or by using visual code where all changes have been manually commented.
